### 2/17/18_a - Defining Data Science, 6 weeks later.
The first question in the soup: "What is Data Science?"  Data Science is a notoriously nebulous term, but when asked to describe it quickly, I've since described it to my friends as fundamentally the intersection of three things:

  1. Statistics
  2. Computer programming and automation
  3. Applied domain knowledge.

It's not enough to just say that Data Science is the intersection of these fields. What good is it? What is it for? Why use it? What ethical questions are important when discussing it? This was the topic of the first "investigation" presentation I gave, about three and a half weeks ago:

Getting back to a good definition though, I'm going to personally settle for this for now:

"Data science is the field that seeks to answer empirical questions about specific domains (such as medicine, advertising, social sciences, marketing, finance, education, etc) by scaling up the statistical methods traditionally used by these fields with the power of machine learning."

[But what's machine learning?](https://jonkislin.github.io/question_soup_2/)
