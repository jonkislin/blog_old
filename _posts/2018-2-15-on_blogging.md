12/15/18  - "Question Soup." I'm not sure if I coined the term or if I adapted it from elsewhere or if that even makes a difference. What does it mean? It kind of means... 'to be so overwhelmed with both questions and ideas for possible answers to those questions that articulation (at least verbally, in real-time) becomes next to impossible and at the very least obviously awkward. As my friend [Arina](www.arigu.me/) says (paraphrasing): "We don't think linearly, but to speak we have to put words together linearly." But is that true about writing? Is writing linear? Is _effective_ writing linear? This post is an attempt to explore that question naively.
