So, week one of Metis is over! As a whole, it flew by, but it was also intellectually exhausting.

### Project Benson

For our first project, we were tasked with recommending a plan of action for a fictional organization: _WomenTechWomenYes_. As the scenario goes, this group wants to determine which subway stations they should sent their field team to collect signatures promising attendance for their annual Gala. Our job was to explore [MTA turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) and propose... something. Intentionally vague. Eek.  

Basically every group decided that above and beyond station ridership, income was important, so it would make sense to filter stations by high-income before looking at the ridership numbers. To make a long story short, our group [Browning], [Jit], and [Jaydon] kept it that simple.

Travelling into New York by Long Island Railroad on a weekday rush hour is something else entirely.  
Until now, I only ever entered or exited Manhattan on a weekend, with rare exceptions. Manhattan has always had a humbling effect on me.
