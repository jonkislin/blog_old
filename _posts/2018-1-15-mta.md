So, week one of Metis is over! As a whole, it flew by: everyone here I've talked to has utterly impressed me, and it's really exciting to work with and talk to people who are so intellectually stimulating.

Paradoxically, the week also dragged on: imposter syndrome is as tenacious as they claim. A few people have bachelor's and master's degrees from Ivy League schools - something I always find to be intimidating.  

Still, as much as my inner demons even now tell me I'll never be as good as everyone else here, I think it'd be foolish not to realize there's a wealth of insights to be gained in continuing to interact with these awesome folks.

### Data exploration

For our first project, we were tasked with recommending a plan of action for a fictional organization: 'WomenTechWomenYes'. As the scenario goes, this group wants to determine which subway stations they should sent their field team to collect signatures promising attendance for their annual Gala. Our job was to explore [MTA turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) and propose... something. This was left intentionally vague. Eek.  

Basically every group decided that above and beyond station ridership, income was important (logic: higher income = more donations and attendance), so it would make sense to filter stations by high-income before looking at the ridership numbers.  

In short, our group ([Browning](https://bgentry91.github.io/Detail_in_Reporting/), [Jit](https://jitsen-design.github.io), Jaydon, and I) stuck primarily to analyzing income and foot-traffic. Page through Browning's [post](https://bgentry91.github.io/Detail_in_Reporting/) for some representative visualizations, and through Jit's for how we defined and operationalized income.

I'm admittedly new to data exploration with python and pandas, and the majority of the exploratory, analytical, and visualiation work was Browning's and Jit's. I did manage to write some useable reverse-geocoding python code, though:  

#### Reverse geocoding station geo-coordinates:
```python
import re
from geopy.geocoders import GoogleV3

# use pandas to import the csv and isolate the coordinates
# import pandas as pd
# pd.read_csv('station_coords.csv')
# coords = [(get a list of just the coords)]

# Pinging the gmaps API:  

geo = GoogleV3(api_key = 'your key here')
gads = [geo.reverse(coord) for coord in coords]

rf_gads \
= [address[0].raw['formatted_address'] for address in gads]

raw_zips \
= [re.findall(r'N[YJ] (\w+)',rf_gads[i]) for i in range(len(rf_gads))]

zips = [i[0] for i in raw_zips] # we have our list!
```

[Link to the csv data I'm calling 'station_coords.csv' ](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49/data)

With the above code, we were able to link stations with income in their vicinity at a zip-code level - cool stuff!  

### ...and commuting

Traveling into New York by Long Island Railroad is often an... experience.  

Traveling into New York by Long Island Railroad on a weekday rush hour is something else entirely.  

Until now, I only ever entered or exited Manhattan on a weekend, with rare exceptions. Manhattan has always had a humbling effect on me, but seeing it operate at weekday capacity put my sense of humility into higher gear:

Look at all these folks! They all have their own lives, anxieties, and regrets. How many are currently heartbroken? Which of them is excited about a new job? What is the average 'degrees of separation' between them?

Where I attended undergrad, one could spend an hour outside and not see as many people as one can see in the fleeting moment captured here. I'm not going to wax poetic ad infinitum. Instead, here's a word that pretty much defines the theme of my week:

[Sonder:](http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/23536922667/sonder)  `n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.`
