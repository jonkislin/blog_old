It went by both really fast and really slow. **Fast**, because I met a group of awesome, accomplished folks who are inspiring me every day to do better in my own academic/professional pursuits, and we're learning really powerful tools, and **slow**, because this past week (and even this past weekend) was intellectually exhausting.
I never knew exploratory data analysis could be so time-consuming, frustrating, and demoralizing (at times).  


### Project Benson

For our first project, we were tasked with recommending a plan of action for a fictional organization: _WomenTechWomenYes_. As the scenario goes, this group wants to determine which subway stations they should sent their field team to collect signatures promising attendance for their annual Gala.
