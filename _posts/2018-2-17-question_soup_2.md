### 2/17/18_b - Machine Learning
_Super rough, will update_  
"Machine Learning" is kind of a silly term in my view. Yeah, you're "training" models, but the models are just generated by statistical and linear algebraic formula. Not to confuse the term "sparse matrices," but as far as learning goes, I think "matrices" are a particularly sparse substitute for the biological processes that drive human (and animal) learning.
